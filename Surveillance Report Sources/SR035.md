"Mozilla Firefox tweaks Referrer Policy to shore up user privacy"
-Firefox 87, due to ship March 23, will reduce the information from referrer headers to better protect user privacy.
-HTTP Referrers often indicate which site a user came from - or was "referred" by. This often contains "innocent" information concerning analytics but can sometimes contain private user data. They are a popular method of tracking users online.
-For those who speak tech: the new policy default will be "strict-origin-when-cross-origin."
-Second link: Firefox will also include "SmartBlock," "providing local stand-ins for blocked third-party tracking scripts." From what I was told, this is more of a uBlock-type thing but it has the potential to turn into a Decentraleyes/LocalCDN type thing. Regardless, I approve of more privacy features that block third-party tracking like this. (https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/03/23/introducing-smartblock/)

-Netop has announced their plans to roll out encryption in the near future. Some of the other privelege escalation bugs have already been rolled out.
