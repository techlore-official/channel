-Just the latest in a long-running list of Facebook data breaches

"RBI orders MobiKwik to probe alleged data leak: source"
-This COMPLETELY flew under my radar last week, thank you to viewers/listeners for bringing this to our attention.
-MobiKwik is a "digital payments firm" from India.
-This article didn't go into detail on how many users were affected or the full extent of the data breached, but they did mention that information included credit card details.
-MobiKwik is denying any data breach, but the evidence isn't looking good for them.

"Ransomware group targets universities in Maryland, California in new data leaks"
-"The Clop ransomware group has posted financial documents and passport information allegedly belonging to the University of Maryland and the University of California online."
-Leaked data includes photos, names, home address, SSN, immigration status, dates of birth, and passport numbers.
-"Clop is one of many threat groups that will employ a 'double-extortion' tactic, in which ransomware may be deployed on a compromised machine first, and then the cybercriminals threaten to make corporate or sensitive stolen datasets public on a leak site unless blackmail demands are met."
-Earlier this month, Clop leaked ata allegedly belonging to universities in Miami and Colorado.Okay,

"GitHub Arctic Vault likely has leaked MedData patient records"
-This one's a little different and odd.
-Data of 150,000 to 200,000 patients appears to come from mulitple healthcare facilities as part of a data breach attributed to MedData, "a national provider of healthcare revenue cycle management solutions."
-This is really cool and I knew nothing about this. GitHub has a program called Arctic Code Vault in which they take various open-source code, print it onto "hardened flim designed to last for a thousand years," then ship it off to Svalbard, Norway for posterity. For those who haven't heard of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, check that out.
-However, due it's popularity, GitHub is used for more than just code, for example Techlore's sources for this show, PTIO's community suggestions, and storing malware or bad code. As such, if the MedData breach was stored on GitHub, then it was likely caught up in this program.
-The actual breach happend in September of 2019 and wasn't taken down til December of 2020. Affected patients are just now being notified.

-I discussed the Ubiquiti breach on my old podcast. This occured in January of this year and was purported to involve limited account credentials.
-A whistleblower is now alleging that this was not the case, that the breach was much worse and that the company downplayed it to avoid damages to their stock, and furthermore that the official story was a cover.
-The whistleblower alleges that the attackers had full read/write access to Ubiquiti's AWS databases, giving them access to source code, keys, and more. The attackers also left a backdoor.

-With the release of iOS 14.5, Apple will begin requiring apps to comply with Apple's App Tracking Transparency initiative. This will require apps to ask user permission explicitly before tracking them.
-As of this week, Apple began to reject app updates that did comply with ATT, suggesting that iOS 14.5 is immenent.
-Apple is flagging third-party issues, meaning that potentially tens of thousands of apps - as much as 18% of the App store - could be affected if the third-party libraries they use don't update.

-PayPal has previously allowed users to purchase Bitcoin, but now they will allows people to accept payments in Bitcoin.
-If I understand this article right, this is a bit misleading. It automatically converts the crypto into local currency and then performs the transaction. So you're not actually transacting crypto. No word on if the amount is converted back into crypto on the seller's end.

"Mobile Handset Privacy: Measuring The Data iOSand Android Send to Apple And Google"
-Only a 10 page paper
-Abstract: "We  investigate  what  data  iOS  on  an  iPhone  shares with  Apple  and  what  data  Google  Android  on  a  Pixel  phone shares with Google. We find that even when minimally configured and  the  handset  is  idle  both  iOS  and  Google  Android  share data  with  Apple/Google  on  average  every  4.5  mins.  The  phone IMEI,  hardware  serial  number,  SIM  serial  number  and  IMSI, handset  phone  number  etc  are  shared  with  Apple  and  Google. Both  iOS  and  Google  Android  transmit  telemetry,  despite  theuser  explicitly  opting  out  of  this.  When  a  SIM  is  inserted  both iOS and Google Android send details to Apple/Google. iOS sends the  MAC  addresses  of  nearby  devices,  e.g.  other  handsets  and the  home  gateway,  to  Apple  together  with  their  GPS  location. Users  have  no  opt  out  from  this  and  currently  there  are  few,  ifany,  realistic  options  for  preventing  this  data  sharing."

"Critical Flaw Found In Widely Used Netmask Open Source Module"
-A group of five researchers found issues in netmask, an open source library. The flaws could be used for a wide variety of attacks from inserting malicious code into protected networks to stealing sensitive data.
-The flaw appears to be not limited to netmask, but to "a wide range of open source development languages."
-The article is a bit over my head, but as netmask gets 3.1 million weekly downloads and is very rarely updated - and also the way this vulnerability impacts many other projects - this has the potential to be bad.

"Incognito mode is not as secret as it seems"
-No duh, but a good reminder for anyone who's new.
-Researchers at VPNoverview found that while using Incognito Mode on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge online activities and user location continued to be transmitted by the ISP to the websites.
-No shocker, Chrome is the worst offender which shares IP address, activity, and identity. Safari fails to hide user history and IP address. Firefox had the best incognito mode, but still does not make users anonymous for websites or ISPs.
-Lesson: Incognito mode isn't.

-"SENS (the Wi-Fi Sensing Project) is envisioned as a way for devices capable of sending and receiving wireless data to use Wi-Fi signal interference differences to measure the range, velocity, direction, motion, presence, and proximity of people and objects."

-"This bill requires websites hosting adult content to request identity verification for all visitors before accessing the site. The language of the law implies that all website visitors will have to submit hard identification (like a passport, driver's license, or credit card) before they can access any website that happens to host adult content. General websites like Twitter or Reddit, which happen to contain adult content via user submissions, could be affected by this legislation. Additionally, the bill makes independent sex workers and website operators criminally liable if a minor accesses their content, even incidentally."

-"The Home Office argues that Facebook products can be exploited by paedophiles, and is using concerns about child safety to pile pressure on the US company as it tries to upgrade the security of all its services – in particular by extending end-to-end encryption to its Messenger app."
-As I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone, this is just "think of the children" garbage. It's just pure overreach and control and study after study has proven that surveillance of this kind does not make any noteworthy impact in crime. It just subjects law-abiding citizens to being treated like criminals and strips them of their civil rights.

-Banks frequently sell "anonymized" financial data, such as credit and debit card activity and loyalty program information.

-Exact details vary. "For example, your bank will know you shopped at Amazon but not that you bought shoes. But this can readily collapse and become more informative if you shopped at ‘Famous Footwear’ (clearly, you bought shoes). How much you spent is telling too: there’s a big difference between a $10 purchase and a $1000 purchase."
