"Malware Is Now Targeting Apple’s New M1 Processor"
-The M1 chip debut in November, leaving the Intel x86 architecture for ARM architecture.
-x86 has historically been used on computers and ARM on smartphones, but from what I can tell it seems ARM has made major improvements and now offers a low-power competitor. So basically this is the new budget chip.
-Two M1-focused malwares have already surfaced. One is GoSearch22, a Safari extension originally written for x86 but now altered to run on M1.

"New type of supply-chain attack hit Apple, Microsoft and 33 other companies"
-A researcher showed it was possible to execute counterfeit code on networks used by big companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla.
-The trick involves "dependency confusion" or "namespace confusion." Basically if he gives packages the same name as other packages -except a newer version - used by those companies, they automatically download and install the code.
-This vulernerability has been reported and several mitigations have been presented.

https://www.techrepublic.com/article/computer-stored-encryption-keys-are-not-safe-from-side-channel-attacks/
"Computer-stored encryption keys are not safe from side-channel attacks"
-While the paper says this attack is simple, explaining it is not.
-From what I understand, researchers were able to use electromagnetic emissions that a computer naturally and automatically emits to determine information about the encryption computation the computer is doing, thus being able to capture keys and other cryptographic information.
-At this time, the only real solution is a faraday cage, but fortunately I don't think this will be an attack that the average person will see in the wild any time soon.

"LAPD Requested Ring Footage of Black Lives Matter Protests"
-We mentioned recently how more and more police are gaining access to the Ring network of smart doorbells and cameras. This story highlights how that access can be abused
-LAPD requested footage of BLM protests. While only one request for data was excessively broad (asking for footage "related to the recent protests"), many of the emails disclosed were redacted so we don't know exactly what times they requested or what incidents they pertained to. Due to the nature of criminal investigation, it's likely that hours of innocent, law-abiding citizens were caught up in these data requests.
-It is a proven fact that this type of panopticon surveillance has a chilling effect on free speech and lawful protest.

"'Spy pixels in emails have become endemic'"
-Hey is an alleged private email provider - they don't offer zero-knowlege so I personally have never recommended them. This story illustrates why, as well as an overarching problem.
-Hey did some research and found that 2/3 of emails sent to it's users (!) contained a "spy pixel."
-Also known as "tracking pixels," in the case of email these can record information including but not limited to if and when an email is opened, how many times, what devices were involved, and physical location by IP address.
-Solution: set your email to not load images by default. Article that follows goes into detail on that.

"Bluetooth Overlay Skimmer That Blocks Chip"
-Criminals have developed a panel they can lay over a typical card-reading point-of-sale system that blocks the chip, forcing users to use the magnetic strip which is easier for criminals to swipe.
-Since the panel overlaid the original panel, criminals could also capture the PIN as it was entered.
-The panel could be installed in seconds simply by laying it over the existing panel.
-The panels went undetected for weeks. Remember to use cash.
