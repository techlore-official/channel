"Microsoft Exchange zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in attacks against US local governments"
-This is a huge story with a lot to unpack and we could post any number of links about it. This is basically the next SolarWinds attack.
-Basically four Zero Day vulnerabilities were discovered in Microsoft's Exchange Server Software.
-Microsoft has already released patches and is urging users to update - as is the US Government - but as always updates are slow and often fall on deaf ears
-Cybercriminals, however, are wasting no time in abusing the vulnerabilities. The past week has seen an avalanche of hacks ranging from governments, schools, retailers, and pretty much anybody you can think of.
-This is a huge story and expect to see it in the headlines - as well as the fallout - for months to come.

"T-Mobile To Step Up Ad Targeting of Cellphone Customers"
-As of April 26, 2021 T-Mobile customers who do not opt out of data sharing will have their data shared with advertisers for more relevant ads.
-Previously this was opt-in, it it is now opt-out. Sad.

"Amazon expands its palm recognition payment tech to more of its stores"
-Amazon last year began to roll out Amazon One, which allows customers to pay using a palm-print. It is already available in several stores in Seattle and will be expanding.
-"Palm scanning technology has been around for a few years, and it’s pretty secure as biometric security methods go, though there are concerns about how Amazon might use the data gathered as part of the system."

Browsers
https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-browser-attack-allows-tracking.html
"New Browser Attack Allows Tracking Users Online With JavaScript Disabled"
-Researchers have discovered a way to track users using CSS and HTML. JavaScript is essentially a programming language, which makes running it dangerous as it has a lot of power. This is why many hardcore privacy enthusiasts disable it whenever possible. JavaScript is frequently used for tracking and often subverted for other malicous purposes. This is a new method, however, that would still work even without JavaScript. The exact details of this are a little too technical for me, but short version is that it's a side-chain attack meaning it pays attention to other things besides the actual code.

https://www.techrepublic.com/article/darpa-taps-intel-to-help-build-the-holy-grail-of-encryption/
"DARPA taps Intel to help build the holy grail of encryption"
-The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - aka DARPA or the unregulated mad scientists of the DoD - is teaming up with Intel to create "fully homomorphic encryption."
-"Fully homomorphic encryption has been described as the "holy grail" of encryption because it allows encrypted data to be used without ever having to decrypt it. Fully homomorphic encryption isn't fantasy—it already exists and is usable, but it is incredibly impractical. "FHE adoption in the industry has been slow because processing data using fully homomorphic encryption methods on cryptograms is data intensive and incurs a huge 'performance tax' even for simple operations," Intel said in a press release."
-Microsoft is also contributing cloud infrastructure and technical expertise.

"Mental Health Apps Aren't All As Private As You May Think"
-An investigation from Consumer Reports this week studied 7 apps specifically positioned as mental health apps and found that they were collecting wide amounts of data and tracking individual users.

"OpenAI’s state-of-the-art machine vision AI is fooled by handwritten notes"
-Researchers at OpenAI have discovered that their AI can be fooled by "typographic attacks" where you simply write something on the object.
-This is just another reminder that AI, facial recognition, and machine learning are not yet ready to have any real, serious role in society. Right now it's still a novelty that requires a lot of oversight. Maybe someday it can be useful for certain applications, but not yet.

"On Not Fixing Old Vulnerabilities"
-Researchers Positive Technologies found that 26% of companies they tested were still vulnerability to WannaCry and Heartbleed, cyber threats dating all the way back to 2013.
-Don't rely on companies to keep your data safe.

"Virginia governor signs comprehensive data privacy law"
-The US State of Virginia has signed into a law a consumer data protection law. It has some good sides and bad.
-The good: there is now a data privacy law where previously there was none. It gives consumers the right to opt out of having personal data processed for targeted advertising and a right to know the status of their data.
-The bad: individuals cannot sue companies for violating the law directly, they must go through the state attorney general.

"City of Pittsburgh signs 4-year deal with Google Cloud"
-Not much to elaborate here, just something that listeners should be aware of. Governments around the world frequently partner with Big Tech companies like Google or Amazon for cloud services. Be careful what data you give up. Don't break any laws but be cautious.

"Iris Scan Serves As Traveler ID At Dubai Airport"
-Dubai is allowing customers to use "contact-free" iris scans to go through security at airports. The scans are tied to the country's "extensive" facial recognition database.
-Dubai is a very wealthy, technologically advanced country, so this isn't surprising. It's just another example of how biometric data is becoming commonplace.

"Bangladesh bought phone-hacking tools from Israel, documents show"
-Cellebrite - known and hated among hardcore privacy enthusiasts in the west - is a forensic technology company that largely helps governments hack phones.
-Bangladesh bought tools from Cellebrite. Bangladesh is currenly considered an authoritarian repressive government.
-Ironically, Cellebrite is an Israeli copmany. This is funny because Bangladesh refuses to acknowledge Israeli sovereignty and has an embargo on Israel. Guess illegal surveillance changes things.

"Signal Appears To Have Abandoned Their AGPL-licensed Server Sourcecode"
-This is a story that's been popping up a lot lately but really became a hot topic last week. Signal hasn't publicly updated their server's Git repo since April of 2020. Some researchers claim that the app APIs indicate that the server has been updated since then but the code hasn't been posted.
-Analysis: Signal is still technically safe to use, but this is worriesome.

"Bitwarden Send"
-Bitwarden has added a new ephemeral file-sharing services. According to their site, it can be used for "passwords, documents, credentials, and more."
-I tried to test it out, it seems sending files requires a premium account but sending text and credentials should be free.
-It looks like it has potential.

-This week, Linux Torvalds - founding developer of linux - warned the world not to use the latest release candidate for Linux 5.12.
-Long story short, there was a bug that caused data to be randomly overwritten which could quickly corrupt a machine.
-This shouldn't affect most users as this is a release candidate - meaning it's still in testing - but it's a good reminder to keep backups.

"Malicious apps on Google Play dropped banking Trojans on user devices"
-Title pretty self explanatory. The apps included were such as "Cake VPN, Pacific VPN, BeatPlayer, QR/Barcode ScannerMAX," etc. The moral is to be careful what apps you download and never trust free VPNs.
